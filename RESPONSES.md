# CISC230 - TALHA CELIK

## factorial2.cpp Done

1.  n= 6, count = 7  
    n= 11, count = 12  
    n= 10000, count= 10001  

2. The input that effects the number of calls is n, the number you are computing the factorial of.

3. The function base on n is n+1.

## ireverse2.cpp ?


1.  n= 12, count = 3  
    n= 123, count = 4  
    n= 12345, count= 6  

2. The input that effects the number of calls is digit number of n, the number you are reversing.

3. ?

## sreverse2.cpp

1.  s= deneme, count = 6
