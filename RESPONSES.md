# CISC230 - TALHA CELIK

## factorial2.cpp Done

1.  n= 6, count = 7  
    n= 11, count = 12  
    n= 10000, count= 10001  

2. The input that effects the number of calls is n, the number you are computing the factorial of.

3. The function base on n is n+1.

## ireverse2.cpp Done


1.  n= 12, count = 3  
    n= 123, count = 4  
    n= 12345, count= 6  

2. The input that effects the number of calls is digit number of n, the number you are reversing.

3. count = (number of digits in n) + 1,
if we need to show with n, logn10+2 n>0 

## sreverse2.cpp Done

1.  s= deneme, count = 6  
    s= talhacelik, count = 10    
    s= fenerbahcesporkulubu, count= 20    

2. The lenght of the string s affects the number of calls.

3. The function based on the input is: count = n, where n is lenght of string.  
or 
 count = s.size()

## permute.cpp Done

1. input: "ab" (n=2), count = 5 
   input: "abc" (n=3), count= 16 
   inpu: "abcd" (n=4), count= 65

2. The length n of the string impacts the number of calls.

3. Complex formula needed to count calls. There is exponential growth.

## tower.cpp Done

1. n=2, count = 7  
   n=3, count = 15 
   n=4, count = 31  

2. The number of disks n impacts the number of count. (calls)

3. Formula to find number of recursive call is, 2^(n+1) -1 

## fibonacci2.cpp (presented in video lesson) Done

1.  n= 10, count = 55  
    n= 20, count = 6765    
    n= 50, count= 3996334433  

2. The value of N impacts the number of calls. 

3. The number of calls when computing F... Hard.
